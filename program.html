                            Tailoring medical treatment strategies to the covariates of specific patient
                            subgroups or even to individuals has shown highly promising results in improving
                            therapeutic outcomes. To enable personalized therapeutic approaches, a first
                            essential step is to identify or learn the causal relationships between medical
                            interventions, patient covariates and disease progression or improvement. We
                            illustrate this using a real-world data challenge on cellular information retrieval.
                            Machine-learning methods such as Random Forests can provide deeper insights into
                            potentially relevant biomarkers that distinguish healthy from diseased groups. In
                            the context of rare immune disorders, such methods allow hidden relationships to be
                            uncovered in a significantly shorter time frame compared to manual analysis. Because
                            the data is usually collected across multiple days, transport mapping is required to
                            appropriately normalize the distributions to ensure technical variation does not
                            interfere with patient-specific individuality. We further investigate under which
                            mathematical conditions this transformation is justified. Once these relationships
                            are established and a predictive model has been constructed, sequentially incoming
                            patient data can be integrated with model predictions. This enables the use of rein-
                            forcement-learning techniques for optimal decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.

                        Graphhomomorphisms for Learning on Molecules

                            Neural Graph Pattern Machines (GPMs) have established themselves as a powerful
                            paradigm, empirically outperforming Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) by
                            overcoming the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman expressivity upper bound. However, while
                            their ability to distinguish more graphs than 1-WL is understood, a rigorous
                            framework explaining their statistical stability and generalization capabilities
                            on molecular tasks remains missing. In this work, we bridge this gap by grounding
                            GPMs in the theory of Graph Limits. We demonstrate that stochastic pattern sampling
                            is not merely a heuristic for feature extraction, but an efficient Monte-Carlo
                            estimator for Homomorphism Densities, which form a complete basis for the topology
                            of sparse graphs, the ”Graphings”. This perspective shifts the focus from discrete
                            separation to continuous estimability: We utilize the Benjamini-Schramm topology to
                            formally characterize which molecular properties are learnable independent of system
                            size, and which are not. Building on this, we address critical shortcomings of current
                            path-based GPMs: (i) We introduce a Multi-Pattern Basis to capture degree moments and
                            spectral properties that paths miss; (ii) We extend the notion of graphhomomorphisms
                            to the 3D space of molecules and prove their Lipschitz stability to resolve chirality;
                            and (iii) We extend the from attention-based correlations introduced by the GPM to 
                            Structural Interventions, enabling causal reasoning and explainability. Our framework
                            provides the theoretical guarantee that GPMs do not just memorize finite structures,
                            but approximate the underlying physical laws of the molecular limit object.

                            The accurate reconstruction and prediction of the near-Earth space environment are crucial
                            for anomaly detection, empirical model development, and a deeper understanding of physical
                            processes. Data assimilation (DA) provides a powerful framework for obtaining reanalysis
                            and forecasts that integrate model and observational uncertainties. This work reviews recent
                            advances in the application of Kalman filtering tech-niques to the outer radiation belt system.
                            We discuss the assimilation of electron flux observations into diffusion models of the radiation
                            belts, followed by the implementation of a split-operator technique to address challenges
                            encountered when applying full 3D Kalman filters. Additionally, we highlight the development
                            of 3D split-operator standard Kalman filter, together with extensions to higher-dimensional
                            ensemble Kalman Filtering approaches. The application of Kalman filtering techniques has been
                            demonstrated in the development of a real-time forecasting of radiation belt electron fluxes.
                            Furthermore, in this presentation we explore the uses of DA-based reanalysis for not just global
                            state analysis of the radiation belts, but also for potential identification of missing physical
                            processes, error assessment using innovation vectors, and intercalibration of data assimilation
                            techniques across multiple missions.

                            Integrative factor models have proven to be crucial for identifying reproducible
                            biological pathways shared by different cancer studies that traditional factor
                            analysis approaches may miss due to systematic biases. Existing integrative
                            factor models, while valuable, often neglect the impact of covariates and confounders,
                            introducing bias into the signal and/or lack a study-specific factor structure totally
                            independent of the common latent structure. Moreover, these models require post-processing
                            steps for loadings, such as varimax rotation, and restrictions on the loading matrix for
                            identifiability, essential for interpretation.
                            To address these challenges, we present a novel class of integrative factor models:
                            "Rotational Invariant Sparse Factor Models" (RISFM). RISFM displays several advantages:
                            1) Providing sparse low-dimensional common and study-specific factors while adjusting for
                            confounding effects using Bayesian methods. 2) Addressing identifiability issues crucial
                            for interpretation through the l1-ball prior. 3) Ensuring computational efficiency for
                            practical applicability. We validate the proposed RISFM approach through extensive
                            simulations and its application to hepatocellular carcinoma human-mice gene expression
                            cancer data. The results showcase the utility of RISFM to determine the overall human-mice
                            genomic similarities, to identify the most appropriate mouse model for studying different
                            human patient sub-populations, and to obtain the co-regulation mechanisms that are
                            idiosyncratic to only humans or mice. The main goal is to improve the current understanding
                            of mouse mutation models and contribute to develop new ones for precision medicine.

                            Bayesian filtering is a fundamental methodology for online inference in stochastic
                            dynamical systems, but the performance of practical algorithms deteriorates severely
                            in high-dimensional settings, where standard methods often become unstable or inaccurate.
                            In this work we investigate a class of constrained Bayesian filtering methods designed
                            to address this challenge in discretely-observed diffusion systems. The key idea is to
                            restrict the filtering distribution to suitably chosen feasible sets that reflect
                            structural properties of the model and the data, thereby excluding unstable or implausible
                            states while retaining the essential statistical information. We develop a theoretical
                            framework to analyse the stability and accuracy of such constrained filters, establishing
                            conditions under which they provide convergent approximations with explicit rates. Finally,
                            we discuss practical implementation issues and present numerical experiments which show how
                            constrained Bayesian filtering offers a robust and scalable approach to online inference.

                            Bayesian inference for models with intractable likelihoods requires balancing
                            accuracy and computational cost. We propose an amortized MCMC-based approach
                            that matches the accuracy of the exchange algorithm while significantly reducing
                            computation. A gradient-informed grid selection combined with Hermite interpolation
                            yields an accurate and efficient surrogate model, as demonstrated by application
                            to a Potts model.

                            We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical
                            activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution
                            equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic
                            kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine

                            the solution for uncertainty quantification (UQ), and examine the regularity of the
                            solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and

                            Satellite observations play a critical role in numerical weather prediction. In the traditional
                            Ensemble Kalman Filter, these observations are assimilated by weighting their associated errors
                            against model uncertainties to produce an optimal estimate. This process requires radiative
                            transfer simulations for passive, downward-viewing satellite radiometers operating in the visible,
                            infrared, and microwave spectra. Typically, such simulations rely on numerically integrating
                            physical laws via models like RTTOV. In talk, we  discuss two data-driven surrogate operators:
                            First, a fully data driven surrogate operator and second, a data driven correction operator for
                            radiative transfer based on modern machine-learning architectures from computer vision. Whereas
                            the former is a fully data-driven emulator,  for the latter, our method adopts an incremental,
                            hybrid formulation: the network learns only the residuals with respect to RTTOV, thereby embedding
                            established radiative-transfer physics into the surrogate while enabling data-driven refinement in
                            complex, cloud-affected conditions.

                            In state and parameter estimation problems, nested particle filters are a
                            particularly suitable approach for sequentially incoming data, as they enable
                            uncertainty quantification while simultaneously approximating the latent signal
                            and the model parameters. However, the computational complexity associated with
                            the large number of required particles often renders such methods impractical.
                            In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme that dynamically adjusts the
                            number of particles at both the inner and outer levels, thereby reducing computational
                            cost while maintaining acceptable levels of estimation accuracy.
